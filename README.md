# Sunrise, Sunset Times and Population Data Across U.S. Cities

This web map, created by Collins in December 2022, visualizes the sunrise and sunset times along with population data for the 990 largest cities in the United States.

Feel free to reach out to me at emezieugwuozor@gmail.com if you'd like to discuss the project further.

Special thanks to Dr. Becky Seifried, Geospatial Information Librarian at UMass Amherst Libraries, for her guidance and mentorship.

A big thanks as well to SimpleMaps US City Database for providing the data used in this project.
